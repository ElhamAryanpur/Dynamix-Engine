# EGB-Engine
A Game Engine For Humans!

# About

[Docs](https://elhamaryanpur.github.io/EGB-Engine/)

This is a game engine that uses Phaser JS as core and builds desktop and mobile games with ELang programming language that will be soon released. Currently coming with IDE and under development for some time. New updates will be commited every day. Let me know if you want to contribute! It really helps ;)

The original idea for this project was and is to build a game engine for [Royal Studios](https://discord.gg/g63g9zJ)!

# Technology
This engine uses WebGL at core. if WebGL was not supported, it will automatically use Canvas. The editor is made with python and comes with custom python environment with everything needed pre-installed for development. The target platforms are any platform that can render HTML file, with windows being special as directly publishing with custom web browser made for game will be avalaible as well. Other techs used will be file_ext library made by me for data storing securely and ELang as scripting language for the engine.

I know the core of the engine is updated regularly, but for the sake of EGB-Engine, I'll go with only one version and then bring new features with new updates.

# Give a star for motivational support ;)

# Will Feature on 1.0:
1. Powerful and fast 2D rendering
2. Powerful and fast 2D physics
3. Support for any platform that can render HTML5
4. Support for Itch.io, Facebook Games, or other online game hosting services
5. Easy to code programming language with ELang.JS
6. Editor with events to end the need of scripting
7. Live view of changes you make to game
8. No cost ever either for commercial or free or even modification

# UPDATES:
1. Keyboard shortcuts added: ctrl + (s, l, r, i, e) for different actions! ctrl + s for saving, ctrl + l for loading, ctrl + i for import, ctrl + r for running the game, ctrl + e for export (which will come soon!)

2. ELang support: ELang is a programming language that is aimed to look just like Human's English language in syntax and support! it automates most of things for you. Firstly build with python, then turned to c++ with ELang++ version (will be uploaded to github soon), and not ELang++ has a port to JavaScript with name of ELangJS too for sake of this engine! A complete syntax example can be seen on this repo's static/lib/ELangJS_syntax.elpp.

3. Added Importing And Retriving Asset support (because it is not allowed natively on browsers to access external data).

# Will Feature in next update:

1. Documentation

2. Exporting and publishing support

3. Examples and game templates to start making right away

4. A WYSIWYG editor

5. Events, to do coding graphically

6. Some UI updates...
