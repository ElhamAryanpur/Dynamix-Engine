# About

This is a game engine that uses Phaser JS as core and builds desktop and mobile games with ELang programming language that will be soon released. Currently coming with IDE and under development for some time. New updates will be commited every day. Let me know if you want to contribute! It really helps ;)

The original idea for this project was and is to build a game engine for [Royal Studios](https://discord.gg/g63g9zJ)!

# Technology
This engine uses WebGL at core. if WebGL was not supported, it will automatically use Canvas. The editor is made with python and comes with custom python environment with everything needed pre-installed for development. The target platforms are any platform that can render HTML file, with windows being special as directly publishing with custom web browser made for game will be avalaible as well. Other techs used will be file_ext library made by me for data storing securely and ELang as scripting language for the engine.

I know the core of the engine is updated regularly, but for the sake of EGB-Engine, I'll go with only one version and then bring new features with new updates.
