# About

EGB-Engine is a game engine build originally to thank Royal Studios team.

EGB-Engine is build with aim of simplifying the task of game development,
while not losing all the sweet things game engines offer! Currently going pre-alpha
after this documentation is written and is able to make a full blown
web game!

The engine use Phaser 3 as engine as building a custom engine can be both resource hungry and not a good idea!
Phaser was choosed due to it meeting all requirement:

1. Cross-platform
2. Web based
3. Easy to use
4. Small in size

Currently, The EGB-Engine is 2D, but 3D engine also be added on version 2 or 3 with help
of babylon engine.

A WYSIWYG editor for the engine will be added soon as well as native exporting and 
steam/google play/apple app store/ ... in version 1.0
